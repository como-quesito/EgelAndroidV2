       <h2>B4. Aplicación de modelos matemáticos (5% del examen y 9 reactivos)</h2>

     <p>
         It is widely accepted by now that the development of software is an engineering
         discipline. To underline this we speak of software engineering and also of system
         engineering in cases where the software is embedded into a system context.
         Typically, all engineering disciplines of today are based on theoretical and, in
         particular, on mathematical foundations. These theoretical foundations are used as a
         basis for a deeper understanding of the engineering task, for a body of rules,
         procedures and engineering processes. There cannot be any doubts that software
         engineering has and needs its own theoretical and mathematical foundation like any
         other engineering discipline.<br>
         Software engineering, in practice, deals with the development of large and often
         complex information processing systems. This includes techniques for the
         description of requirements and systems in the disparate development phases. The
         main goals of software engineering are a good quality of the engineering process and
         its results, the timely delivery of the end procuct, and high productivity. In this paper
         we ignore most of the economical aspects and sketch how a mathematical basis of the
         technical aspects of system and software engineering may look like.<br>

       <h3>Métodos formales</h3>
       <p>
       Starting with the pioneering work of Backus, Bauer, Samelson, McCarthy, Petri,
       Strachey, Scott, Dijkstra, Floyd, Hoare, deBakker, Reynolds, Milner, the VDM
       group and many others formal methods in software development have been
       extensively investigated over the last 25 years. Today formal methods are a wellestablished
       subject in academia.<br>
       After denotational semantics, axiomatic specifications and numerous logical
       calculi are available, many of the theoretical problems for modelling software
       engineering concepts by mathematical and logical techniques are solved (see also
       [Abrial 92]). More work is needed, however, along the lines of [Jones 86] and
       [Guttag, Horning 93] to make the theoretical work better accessible to software
       engineers working in practice. The fact that theoretical foundations are sufficient
       already today to cover the foundations of pragmatic methods is demonstrated, for
       instance, by [Hußmann 95] which provides a complete formalization of the method
       SSADM by translating it into SPECTRUM. SSADM is a pragmatic requirement
       engineering method used as the UK government’s standard method for carrying out
       systems analysis and design stages of information technology development projects.
       SPECTRUM is an axiomatic specification language (cf. [SPECTRUM 93]).<br>
       How many basic problems still have to be studied and how much foundational
       work is still needed and stimulated by practical problems can be seen, for instance,
       by the concept of state charts (see [Beeck 94] for a long list of open problems) for
       describing embedded process control systems. Statecharts (see [Harel 87]) are - also
       due to the fact that they are supported by a commercial CASE tool - by now widely
       used in industry

       <h3>Mathematical Models and System Description</h3>
       <p>
        In the following sections we define mathematical models and description techniques
        for systems and system aspects. In this section we disucuss the role of formal
        methods and mathematics in systems engineering.
        2.1 System Aspects and Views
        A complex information processing system cannot be described in a monolithic way if
        understandability is an issue. It is better to structure its description into a number of
        complementing views. These include:</p>
          <ul>
           <li>data models</li>
           <li>system component models</li>
           <li>distributed system models</li>
           <li>state transition models</li>
           <li>process models</li>
       </ul>
      <br><br>
       <p>
        For each of these aspects of a system a mathematical model is defined in the
        following, consisting of a syntactic and a semantic part. We use these models as a
        basis for giving meaning to more pragmatic description formalisms.
